        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>Welcome to your first step into the world of baking! We’re here to help you go from curious beginner to
            confident home baker — one simple recipe at a time.

            At Baking Basics, we believe that baking doesn’t have to be complicated or overwhelming. You don’t need
            fancy equipment or years of experience to make something truly delicious. All you need is a little guidance,
            some encouragement, and a willingness to learn — and that’s exactly what we’re here for.</p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p> <em>Our mission is simple:</em> to teach baking basics in a way that’s easy to understand, approachable, and
            actually
            fun. Whether you’ve never cracked an egg before or you’ve tried baking but haven’t quite nailed it yet, this
            is the place for you. We break everything down step-by-step, explain the <strong>“why”</strong> behind the
            <strong>“how,”</strong> and share
            tips that make a real difference — like how to properly measure flour, what “room temperature” butter really
            means, and why your cookies might be spreading too much.

            We focus on everyday baking skills that form the foundation for everything else: measuring, mixing,
            kneading, and baking techniques you can build on. You’ll learn how to make simple, satisfying bakes like
            fluffy muffins, soft breads, classic cookies, and basic cakes — with clear instructions, photos, and videos
            to guide you from start to finish.
        </p>

        <h2>What Makes Us Different?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>We remember what it’s like to be brand new. Our content is created by real bakers
                who were once beginners, too.</li>
            <li>We understand how frustrating it can be when your cupcakes sink or
                your dough won’t rise. That’s why we go beyond recipes to offer support, troubleshooting advice, and
                helpful
                explanations that answer all those “wait, am I doing this right?” questions.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We’re proud to have built a welcoming, beginner-friendly baking community where there’s no such thing as
            a silly question. Whether you’re baking solo, with your kids, or just looking for a new creative hobby,
            we’re here to make sure you feel supported and inspired every step of the way.

            So if you’ve always wanted to learn how to bake but didn’t know where to start — you’re in the right
            place. Put on your apron, grab your mixing bowl, and let’s start with the basics. You’ve got this — and
            we’ve got you.</p>
